# The print as a development plugin

For a seat where the Figma MCP server is not available. The plugin is the generated script
in a manifest; nothing else.

`code.js` is the generated print, committed so no Node run is needed on the machine with
the file; `code.mcp.js` is the same print in the form the Figma MCP server's script runner
takes. Both bind variables by name, so neither depends on the seed. To regenerate after a
map change:

```
npm run -s figma:print > scripts/figma/plugin/code.js
npm run -s figma:print:mcp > scripts/figma/plugin/code.mcp.js
```

(`-s` keeps npm's own echo out of the file.)

In the Figma desktop app: Plugins, Development, Import plugin from manifest, and pick
`scripts/figma/plugin/manifest.json`. Run it in the file where okchroma's extended plugin
has written the variables. The plugin closes with a summary of what it created, updated,
skipped and could not find.
